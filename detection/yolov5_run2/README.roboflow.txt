==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on September 29, 2020 at 8:09 PM GMT

It includes 3009 images.
Flowers are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 320x320 (Fit (reflect edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 12 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -8째 to +8째 horizontally and -8째 to +8째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
